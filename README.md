# Damka
* A a basic Damka Windows desktop application using .NET WinForms with an OOP architecture that applies segregation between the classes that manage the logic operations and data of the game and the classes that are responsible for the UI and user interactions.

* The program allows two human players to play against each other by turns, or for a human player to play against the computer, which randomly chooses a move out of the current set of legal moves.

* The game is designed in a way that events are raised from the Logic Layer and handled in the UI layer in order to update the display.
